# U.S. States Game

It's a game written with Python to allow you guess U.S state names. If guessed corretly, the state name will show at the corresponding location of the map.
If you choose to exit the game without guessing all the states, a cvs file will be generated automatically for missed states.

This game can also be played here: https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states

Here is a preview of the game with my Python code:
